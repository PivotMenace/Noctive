<h1>Noctive</h1>

<p><strong>Noctive</strong> is more than just a platform. It’s a digital space designed for gamers, creators, and communities who thrive after dark.</p>
<p>We’re creating the next-generation hub where you can stream, post, clip, squad up, or simply be yourself ... without the noise.</p>

<h2>🌟 What Makes Noctive Different?</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Tag-Based Profiles</strong><br>Customize your profile with your favorite games, roles, or interests. Whether you’re grinding ranked or casually playing Minecraft, others can find you through your gaming preferences.</li>
  <li><strong>Subspaces (called “Void Circles”)</strong><br>Join game-specific threads, fan zones, off-topic areas, or deep night conversations. It’s where you can connect with people who enjoy the same games and topics.</li>
  <li><strong>Smart Duo Finder</strong><br>Filter teammates by skill, mic/no mic, region, or playstyle. Get matched with people who share your gaming habits, making every session more fun and productive.</li>
  <li><strong>Post Feed + Upvotes</strong><br>Share clips, memes, screenshots, or rants. Gain attention, get followed, and make your voice heard across the community.</li>
  <li><strong>(Future) Game Stat Sync</strong><br>Sync your game stats with Noctive to show your progress in real-time. Prove your skills without needing to say a word.</li>
  <li><strong>Badges + Streaks</strong><br>Earn "Night Pulse" badges for daily activity, top-rated posts, or being active when the rest of the world is offline.</li>
</ul>

<h2>👾 Meet Steve</h2>
<p>Steve is our unblinking, always-watching night bird mascot.<br>He’s a little weird, a little tired, and always on... like you.</p>

🚧 *This is a front-end prototype. Interactions are visual only. no database or backend yet.*

I met my two best friends on Moot back in the day.

Moot shut down, leaving a gap in the market for a fun, dedicated gamer social app.

I want something that feels personal, safe, and actually you, not corporate.

💡 Built with love for nostalgic gamers and Venus's closes friends :)
