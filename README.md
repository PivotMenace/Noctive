👁️ Noctive
Not just a platform. A late-night movement.

Noctive is a night-first digital space for gamers, creators, and communities that thrive after dark.
We’re building the next-gen hangout where you can stream, clip, post, squad up, or simply exist without the noise.

✨ What makes Noctive different?
🧿 Tag-Based Profiles
Add your favorite games, roles, or interests. Whether you’re grinding ranked or vibing in Minecraft, people can find you through what you play.

🕳️ Subspaces (called “Void Circles”)
Game-specific threads, fandom zones, off-topic chaos, or deep night advice convos. Find your people.

🔍 Smart Duo Finder
Filter teammates by vibe, skill, mic/no mic, game type, or pure energy. No more shouting into the void.

📣 Post Feed + Upvotes
Drop clips, memes, screenshots, or raw rants. Get noticed. Get followed. Get loud.

📊 (Future) Game Stat Sync
Flex your stats with real-time pulls from your accounts. Prove it, don't say it.

🔥 Badges + Streaks
Earn "Night Pulse" badges for daily drops, top-rated posts, or just being chronically online in the coolest way.

🦉 Meet Steve
He's our unblinking, always-watching night bird mascot.
He’s a little weird, a little tired, and always on — just like you.

🚧 Status: In Progress
This is a passion-fueled mockup project.
We're shaping it live, late at night, with snacks in hand.

I met my two best friends on Moot back in the day.

Moot shut down, leaving a gap in the market for a fun, dedicated gamer social app.

I want something that feels personal, safe, and actually you, not corporate.

💡 Built with love for nostalgic gamers and Venus's closes friends :)
