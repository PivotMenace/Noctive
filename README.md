<h1>Noctive</h1>

<h2>💬 About Noctive</h2>
<p> Hi, My name is Venus, I wanted to create a fun and light hearted platform that was inspired by my two best friends that I cherish to this day!
  
  On other platforms, creators feel like they have to chase what’s trending just to be seen. On Noctive, we flip that. Here, your late-night stream of a weird old game matters just as much as the biggest title. Whether you’re streaming, posting, or just chilling, Noctive is about you being you, not gaming for the algorithm.</p>
<p><strong>Unfollow the algorithm. Noctive follows you.</strong></p>

<h2>🌟 What Makes Noctive Different?</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Tag-Based Profiles</strong><br>Customize your profile with your favorite games, roles, or interests. Whether you’re grinding ranked or casually playing Minecraft, others can find you through your gaming preferences.</li>
  <li><strong>Subspaces (called “Boards”)</strong><br>Join game-specific threads, fan zones, off-topic areas, or deep night conversations. It’s where you can connect with people who enjoy the same games and topics.</li>
  <li><strong>Smart Duo Finder</strong><br>Filter teammates by skill, mic/no mic, region, or playstyle. Get matched with people who share your gaming habits, making every session more fun and productive.</li>
  <li><strong>Post Feed + Upvotes</strong><br>Share clips, memes, screenshots, or rants. Gain attention, get followed, and make your voice heard across the community.</li>
  <li><strong>(Future) Game Stat Sync</strong><br>Sync your game stats with Noctive to show your progress in real-time. Prove your skills without needing to say a word.</li>
  <li><strong>Badges + Streaks</strong><br>Earn "Night Pulse" badges for daily activity, top-rated posts, or being active when the rest of the world is offline.</li>
</ul>

<h2>👾 Meet Steve</h2>
<p>Steve is our unblinking, always-watching night bird mascot.<br>He’s a little weird, a little tired, and always on... like you.</p>

I met my two best friends on Moot back in the day.

Moot shut down, leaving a gap in the market for a fun, dedicated gamer social app.

I want something that feels personal, safe, and actually you, not corporate.

💡 Built with love for nostalgic gamers and Venus's closes friends :)
