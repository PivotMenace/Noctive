<h2>💬 About Noctive</h2>
<p>
  Hi, I’m Venus. I created Noctive because I wanted a space that feels simple, welcoming, and easy to use. The idea came from the way I connected with my closest friends online, and I wanted to build something that brings that same ease and authenticity to others.
</p>
<p>
  Most platforms push people to follow trends just to stay visible. Noctive takes a different approach. If you want to stream an older game at two in the morning, post a clip, or just hang out, it all matters here. No pressure, no chasing numbers.

<p><strong>Unfollow the algorithm. Noctive follows you.</strong></p>

<h2>📌 Note</h2>
<p>
  This is a front end prototype. Features are visual only for now.
</p>
<p>
  Noctive was inspired by the platforms many of us grew up using, especially the ones that no longer exist. I wanted to build something modern that still keeps that community feeling.
