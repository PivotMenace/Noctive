🚧 *This is a front-end prototype. Interactions are visual only. no database or backend yet.*

I met my two best friends on Moot back in the day.

Moot shut down, leaving a gap in the market for a fun, dedicated gamer social app.

I want something that feels personal, safe, and actually you, not corporate.

💡 Built with love for nostalgic gamers and Venus's closes friends :)
