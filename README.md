<h1>Noctive</h1>
<p><strong>Not just a platform. A late-night movement.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Noctive</strong> is a night-first digital space for gamers, creators, and communities that thrive after dark.
We’re building the next-gen hangout where you can stream, clip, post, squad up, or just be real without the noise.</p>

<h2>✨ What makes Noctive different?</h2>
<ul>
  <li><strong>🧿 Tag-Based Profiles</strong><br>
  Add your favorite games, roles, or interests. Whether you’re grinding ranked or chilling in Minecraft, people can find you through what you play.</li>

  <li><strong>🕳️ Subspaces (called “Void Circles”)</strong><br>
  Game-specific threads, fan zones, off-topic chaos, or deep night conversations. Find your people.</li>

  <li><strong>🔍 Smart Duo Finder</strong><br>
  Filter teammates by skill, mic/no mic, region, or playstyle. Get matched with people who actually play like you.</li>

  <li><strong>📣 Post Feed + Upvotes</strong><br>
  Drop clips, memes, screenshots, or rants. Get noticed. Get followed. Get loud.</li>

  <li><strong>📊 (Future) Game Stat Sync</strong><br>
  Flex your stats with real-time pulls from your accounts. Prove it without having to say it.</li>

  <li><strong>🔥 Badges + Streaks</strong><br>
  Earn "Night Pulse" badges for daily drops, top-rated posts, or showing up when everyone else is offline.</li>
</ul>

<h2>🦉 Meet Steve</h2>
<p>He's our unblinking, always-watching night bird mascot.<br>
He’s a little weird, a little tired, and always on... like you.</p>

🚧 *This is a front-end prototype. Interactions are visual only. no database or backend yet.*

I met my two best friends on Moot back in the day.

Moot shut down, leaving a gap in the market for a fun, dedicated gamer social app.

I want something that feels personal, safe, and actually you, not corporate.

💡 Built with love for nostalgic gamers and Venus's closes friends :)
